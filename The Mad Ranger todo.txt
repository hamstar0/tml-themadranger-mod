Plan v1
-	Player begins with a special revolver and a bandolier of unlimited ammo for it (accessory)
-	Revolver has poor aim (is not focused) unless the player is still for 1.5 seconds
-	Gun appears as a held item, and a holster animation occurs when switching away (blocks re-equip fire)
-	Otherwise, aim (focus) improves for an instant upon:
	-	Deploying the gun
	-	Finishing a reload
-	Reload is 1 round at a time, finishing after 6 seconds
-	Reload slows movement speed, and is automatic after trying to fire when empty (hotkey also exists)
-	Gun can be fired fast, and does 20 damage per unfocused hit, 35 damage per focused hit
-	While tipsy, aim is further diminished, but occasional random moments of accurate aim (focus) occur
-	Firing shots diminishes accuracy for 1 second
-	Firing shots without a dash move slows the player's movement for a moment
-	Focus-hitting an enemy re-focuses aim for a moment (longer if further away)
-	Traveling Merchant rarely sells these types of revolvers for 35 gold
